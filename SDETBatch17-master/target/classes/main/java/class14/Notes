Access modifiers:
    Access modifiers are keywords in Java that help us control the access of instance and static variables
    and they can also be used to control the access of methods and classes. There are 4 access levels and
    there are three keywords in Java to apply these access levels.
    1. private - most restricted
    2. protected -
    3. default - in no keyword ie String account; not private String account
                 Can be accessed in the same package but not another package
    4. public - Can be accessed from anywhere within the project

Best Practices:
    Instance variables/fields/properties/attributes are private
    99% of the time
