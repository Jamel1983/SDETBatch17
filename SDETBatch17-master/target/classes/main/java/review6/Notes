What is Object Oriented programming(OOP)?
    It's simply a way of writing code. Some rules that we follow.
    There are other ways as well, like functional programming, procedural programming, statistical computing programming.
    There are four main pillars of OOP:
        1. Inheritance
        2. Polymorphism = Many forms
        3. Abstraction
        4. Encapsulation

Why should we learn OOP:
    1. Code re-usability
    2. Easier to write a large amount of code
    3. Sharing code
    4. Protecting code
    5. Security is increased
    6. Changing code becomes easier

Object:
    An object is something that we can physically touch and see. We can easily represent the object inside computers
    by telling the computer what it looks like and how it behaves.
    Properties and Behavior

Class:
    A class is like a design/map/blueprint that we use to create objects

String class:
    Is used to store and manipulate text based data. Most of the information inside computers is proccessed
    in this form. String is the most widely used class in all Java

Creating objects from String class:
    1. length() - total numbers of characters
    2. isEmpty() - checks if string is empty, returns a boolean
