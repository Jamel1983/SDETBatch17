Types of variables:
    There are three types of variables: local, instance and static

local variable:
    local variables are the variables which are created/declared inside a block of code
    like if else conditions, loop, switch statements, methods are blocks of code.

    upside:
        They occupy the memory for the shortest period of time. As soon as Java is done executing that block of code
        they are removed from the memory. The code that we type using local variables are very easy to debug

    downside:
        They can only be accessed within the block of they are created

instance variable:
    Are created outside of the blocks(If else, switch, loops, methods) of code but inside a class

    upside:
        They can be accessed anywhere within that class

    downside:
        They are created when an object of the class is created and they will stay in the memory as long as that object
        is in the memory, whether you use them or not

Local vs instance:
    Whenever it is possible go and create local variables. Only go with instance variable when you can't solve a
    problem with local variables

Static Variables:
    static variables are created inside a class but outside of a block of code with a static keyword.
    A local variable can never be a static variable

    upside:
        They are universal when it comes to scope and accessibilty. We don't even need to create the object of that
        class in which they are created we can simply write the name of the class and we can access it.

    downside:
        Static variable occupy the memory for longest of all, not more memory. They are created even though you don't create
        any object of that class

Uses of types of local variables:
    Local:
        Whenever we are solving any problem many times we need local variables to temporarily store data.
        In all of those cases you should be going with local variables.
