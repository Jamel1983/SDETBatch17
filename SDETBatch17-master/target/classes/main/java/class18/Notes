Super keyword:
    Is used to access things from the parent class.
    We can access instance variables, methods and constructors

Why should we learn about Super:
    1.  Without super() we can't call the constructor from the parent class and we might have to repeat
        that constructor in all of the class and if someone declares the field private
        we will not be able to even access the fields in child classes.
    2.  We can use super to call the fields from the parent class if we have the same name fields in the child class

Rules
    1. When we use super() we must call at least one constructor from the parent class
        because java needs at least one constructor from parents, as it always first, creates
        the object of the parent class when we create the object of the child class.
    2. When we use super to access the fields as local instance and in the parent class
        Java prefers the local first then the instance of the same class then the instance of the parent class
