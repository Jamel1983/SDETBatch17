MethodOverriding:
    When we have exact same method in parent in child class, we call it method overriding.

Why should we learn about Overriding:
    Method overriding gives us a lot of flexibility for example if we don't like a method from the parent class
    we can override it/change it.

Syntax:
    class Parent{
        void eat(){
            sout "Fish"
        }
    }

    class Child extends Parent{
        void eat(){
            sout "Chicken"
        }
    }
