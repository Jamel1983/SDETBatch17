Method Overloading:
    Method Overloading happens when multiple methods with the same name but with different parameters.
        1.  Different number of parameters for example min(2,3) min(4,5,6)
        2.  Different datatype of methods, for example print("Java") print(12)
        3.  Different sequence/order of parameters, for example print("Java", 12) print(12, "Java")

Why should we learn about method overloading:
    1.  Cleaner code
    2.  We don't need to come up with different method names

Method Overriding:
    Happens when same name method is present in parent as well as in
    child class.
    Benefits:
        1. Flexibility


Signature of a method:
    is the uniqueness of a method: name and its parameters
        add(int num1, int num2)
        add(double num1, double num2)

Header of a method:
    Includes Signature and Return type and Access Modifier
