Constructors:
    Help us build objects from classes easily.
    They help us give initial values to the instance fields.
    The name of the constructor must be the same as the class name.
    Constructors don't have ay return types.
    Most of the time constructors are public.
    Other than initializing the values, we can have whatever type
    of code inside the constructor. Example: if-else etc.
