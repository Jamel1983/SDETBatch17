Encapsulation:
    Create classes to write code and store data. Use private access modifier to secure
    the data by limiting the access. Create getter/setter methods for every field.

Why should we learn about Encapsulation?
    It improves the control over the data that we store in the fields of a class, which leads us to more secure code.

Collections Framework:
    Collections framework in Java contains a lot of classes and interfaces, which help us store and
    manipulate large amounts of data easily and efficiently.

Why Collections Framework:
    Arrays have limitations
    1. The are fixed in size meaning once we provide the size, we can't change it afterwards
    2. They don't have built in methods to help us process the data.
