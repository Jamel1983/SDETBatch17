Maps:
    Maps are dataStructures which stores key value pairs. There are many different types of maps in Java, but we will
    be discussing
    1.  HashMap
    2.  LinkedHashMap
    3.  TreeMap
    4.  HashTable

    Maps are not part of the collections framework. Map is the name of the interface and HashMap, LinkedHashMap,
    TreeMap, and HashTable are the classes that implement this interface. Maps are a collection on entries and entries
    are a collection of key value pairs

    Why we should learn about maps?
        All the other dataStructures that we have learned can only store one value at a time and they are index
        based. Maps allow us to store key value pairs, which makes them a better choice, because we know what
        we are storing.

    Syntax of Maps:
    NameOfTheClass<DataTypeOfKey, DataTypeOfValue> variableName = new NameOfTheClass<>();
    HashMap<String, Double> names  = new HashMap<>();
