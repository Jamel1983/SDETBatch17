Inheritance:
    Inheritance allows one class to have all the properties and methods from another clas except private members
    and constructors. We use extends keyword.

Why should we learn about inheritance:
    1. Faster development
    2. Saves memory
    3. Code re-usability

Syntax:
    class Parent {
    }

    class Child extends Parent{
    }

Rules:
    1. Private members(fields and methods) are not accessible in child classes.
    2. Constructors are also not available for child classes directly.

Types of inheritance:
    1. Single
    2. Hierarchical
    3. MultiLevel
    4. Hybrid
    5. Multiple(Not supported by java)

Single inheritance:
    Only one parent and only one child (Not very common)

Hierarchical:
    One parent multiple child.

MultiLevel:
    child inherits from parent and parent inherits from grandparent
    grandparent -> parent -> child
    Which child can access grandparent and parent

Multiple:
    Multiple parent classes and one child. Java does not allow this

The main disadvantage is tightly coupled
