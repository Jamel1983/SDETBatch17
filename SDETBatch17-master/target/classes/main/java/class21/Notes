Abstraction:
    Abstraction is the process of hiding implementation details and showing only the
    functionality to the end user. We use the abstract keyword with methods to
    avoid the implementation details.
        Why should we use:
            1.  Flexibility(if we don't know or don't want to provide the implementation
                we can skip it)
        Rules:
            1.  we can't create the objects of the abstract classes.
            2.  All the child classes must provide the implementation to the abstract
                methods which are coming from parent or mark the child class also abstract
            3.  An abstract class can have full body methods as well as abstract method
            4.  We can have instance or static fields in an abstract class
            5.  Constructors are also allowed
    How:
        Remove the body of the method and add abstract.
